# Udacity---TMDB-Movies-dataset-analysis

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

## Questions
<ol>
  <li>Which genres are most popular from year to year?</li>
  <li>What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?</li>
</ol>

## Tools and libraries
<p>
  The analysis is written in a jupyter notebook using the python programing language, where libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib are used for various parts of the analysis.
